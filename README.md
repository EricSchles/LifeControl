# LifeControl
The future home of Life Control

The goal of this tool is simple - forced self control for netflix.  Other services to come if folks end up using this.

The way it works is pretty simple, after a number of hours you get logged out of netflix and you won't be able to log back in
for a number of hours.  Of course you can adjust the number of hours you stay logged in for and the number of hours you get
logged out for.  Because the point is, you control your binge watching experience.  

However, changing these preferences should be hard, and not something you can do without really wanting to.  By default,
you'll be logged out after 2 hours and can log back in after 3 hours.
